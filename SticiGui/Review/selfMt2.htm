    <p>The next three questions refer to an article by H. Seppala, M.D., T. Klaukka, M.D., J.
    Vuopio-Varkila, M.D., and 4 others in the 14 August 1997 issue of <strong>The New England
    Journal of Medicine</strong>. The article is entitled <em>The effect of changes in the
    consumption of macrolide antibiotics on erythromycin resistance in group A streptococci in
    Finland.</em> </p>
    <p>Erythromycin is an antibiotic of macrolide type. One thing erythromycin is used for is
    to treat some streptococcal infections, especially in people who are allergic to
    penicillin (streptococci are the kind of bacteria responsible for &quot;strep
    throat,&quot; among other infections). A world-wide concern is that antibiotics are being
    overprescribed, and that their widespread will lead to the proliferation of strains of
    bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics, so antibiotics will become less effective.
    A particular danger is the phenomenon of &quot;cross-resistance:&quot; exposure to one
    antibiotic can select for bacteria that are resistant not only to it, but also to related
    antibiotics. </p>
    <p>The use of erythromycin in Finland roughly tripled in the 1980s, reaching a peak of
    about 3 daily defined doses per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1988. In the early 1990s,
    tests on throat (pharyngeal) cultures and pus samples from Finnish patients nationwide
    showed that about 13% of group A streptococci were resistant to erythromycin, a
    substantial increase from 1988-1989 (about 5% were resistant then). The increase was
    highly publicized, and Finnish physicians were taught about the risks and possible
    alternatives to prescribing erythromycin for respiratory and skin infections. After the
    publicity, there was a decrease in the prescription of macrolide antibiotics (of which
    erythromycin is one), measured by the number of defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants
    per day. Since 1992, the number of defined daily doses of macrolide antibiotics per 1000
    inhabitants has varied between about 1.28 and 1.74. Before 1990, the only macrolide
    antibiotic used in Finland was erythromycin; others are now even more frequently
    prescribed than erythromycin. </p>
    <p>The authors, which include the Finnish Study Group for Antimicrobial Resistance,
    analyzed the erythromycin resistance of group A streptococci isolated from 39,247 throat
    and pus samples obtained between 1991 and 1996. At most one sample per patient per year
    was used, if the patient could be identified. The proportion of erythromycin-resistant
    group A streptococci had increased from about 5% in 1988-1989 to about 13% in 1990. After
    the reduction in the prescription of erythromycin, the relative frequency of
    erythromycin-resistant group A streptococci increased to 16.5% in 1992, and to 19.0% in
    1993, then began falling, to 15.6% in 1994, to 10.0% in 1995, and to 8.6% in 1996. The
    authors analyze these data using a variety of statistical techniques. </p>
    <li>Let us agree to call this an &quot;experiment,&quot; because a policy was deliberately
      introduced to decrease the amount of macrolide antibiotics used in Finland.<br />
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript" ><!--
var opt = ['This is an uncontrolled experiment.',

</li>
<!-- (b) -->
    <li>i) If a decrease in the amount of erythromycin prescribed does cause a decrease in the
      fraction of erythromycin-resistant group A streptococci, population size would tend to
      confound with the apparent effect of defined daily doses per 1000 population.<br />
      ii) A secular trend in the proportion of erythromycin-resistant group A streptococci would
      tend to confound with the apparent effect of defined daily doses per 1000 population.<br />
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript" ><!--

writeRadioExercise(qCtr++,opt,aVal);
// -->
</script>
</li>
<!-- (a) -->
<li>i) Bacteria reproduce very quickly, so one might expect selective pressures on their
      breeding to act quickly. Because the proportion of erythromycin-resistant group A
      streptococci continued to climb for several years after the number of defined daily doses
      per 1000 inhabitants per day had started to fall, and because it took 5 years after the
      prescription of erythromycin was reduced before the proportion of erythromycin-resistant
      group A streptococci fell below the 1989 level, it is quite likely that the association
      between reducing the use of the antibiotic and the proportion of resistant bacteria is
      spurious.<br />
 ii) This work addresses the <em>proportion</em> of erythromycin-resistant group A
      streptococci rather than the <em>number</em> of such streptococci, so it might be that the
      number of erythromycin-resistant group A streptococci was actually smallest when the
      prescription rate was highest. <br />
