      The next few questions refer to a research article by W.J. Spangler, B.S., G.R. Cosgrove,
      M.D., H.T. Ballantine Jr., M.D., E.H. Cassem, M.D., S.L. Rauch, M.D., A. Nierenberg, M.D.,
      and B.H. Price, M.D., 1996. Magnetic Resonance Image-guided Cingulotomy for Intractable
      Psychiatric Disease, <i>Neurosurgery</i>, <i>38</i>, 1071-1078. This article reports on 34
      patients who underwent MRI-guided cingulotomies to treat refractory psychiatric disease at
      Massachusetts General Hospital between May, 1991, and February, 1995.
      <br />
      The 34 patients, 18 male, 16 female, ages 16-71, mean age 37, had all been referred by
      their treating psychiatrists and reviewed by the MGH Cingulotomy Assessment Committee
      (comprised principally of a subset of the authors) to become candidates for the procedure.
      The committee had to agree unanimously that the patient should undergo the procedure, and
      the patient had to give his or her informed consent. Prerequisites for the committee to
      favor treatment included patient's resistance to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, behavior
      therapy, and electro-convulsive therapy (when applicable), and the symptoms had to be
      severe and unremitting for at least one year. All patients had a documented DSM III-R
      disease that interfered significantly with normal functioning (<i>e.g</i>., major
      affective disorder with unipolar depression (10 patients), or bipolar depression (5
      patients), undiagnosible developmental disorders (1 patient), and obsessive-compulsive
      disorder with major depression (15 patients)). For some patients whose condition failed to
      improve 6 months after surgery, additional cingulotomies were performed. <p>The
      cingulotomy procedure is to insert a pair of electrodes into holes drilled in the skull
      just above the hairline, to a pre-determined position in the brain (guided by MRI).
      Radio-frequency electricity is passed through the electrodes, to raise the temperature in
      the part of the brain between the electrodes to 85°C (185°F) for 90 seconds, essentially
      cooking part of the brain between them. (This causes what is called a radio-frequency
      thermocoagulation lesion). The basic procedure was changed in 1993 to include a larger
      part of the brain. </p>
      <p>Of the 34 subjects, 31 were available for follow-up assessment of some sort; of the 31,
      two had committed suicide. Follow-up assessment was done two ways: either the referring
      psychiatrist or the treating psychiatrist completed two questionnaires---the Clinical
      Global Improvement Scale, and the Current, Global, Psychiatric-Social Status Scale---or,
      if the patient was no longer seeing a psychiatrist, the most recent correspondence with
      the patient was used to assign ratings. I could not find a reference to the number of
      patients who were in each of these categories. On the basis of these ratings, each patient
      was classified as a &quot;responder&quot; (R), a &quot;possible responder&quot; (P), or a
      &quot;non-responder&quot; (N).
      <br />
      Fourteen of the patients who had not responded six months after the initial procedure
      underwent multiple procedures. The categorized responses were as follows: </p>

    I wish to study the effect of daily consumption of small amounts of alcohol (say, two
    glasses of wine) on the incidence of heart disease.
    In several European countries, it is
    customary to drink wine with dinner, while in most Islamic countries, it is not. I
    therefore decide to compare the average incidence of heart disease for several European
    countries in which the average daily consumption of wine is two glasses, with the
    incidence of heart disease in Saudi Arabia, where the consumption of alcohol is negligable
    (it is a capital offense).
    It turns out that the incidence of heart disease is lower in Saudi Arabia.<br />

    i) Because individual drinking patterns vary, the assignment of subjects to treatment and
    control is effectively random. <br />
    ii) Because the sample sizes are very large, we should be able to detect a small effect if
    it exists (the test will have good &quot;power&quot; to detect that the null hypothesis is
    false if it is false). <br />
    iii) This is an observational study.
