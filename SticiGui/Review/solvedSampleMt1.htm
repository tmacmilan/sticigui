        electrical stimulation of the gasserian ganglion for the
        relief of pain in a series of 34 patients,&quot; <em>J.
        Neurosurg. 86</em>, 197-202, 1997) report on the
        effectiveness of surgically implanted electrodes for
        reducing facial pain. 34 patients with &quot;chronic
        medically intractable facial pain&quot; underwent the
        procedure; 19 of the cases (56%) were deemed successful,
        in the sense that &quot;there was a reduction of pain by
        at least 50% whenever the stimulator was on.&quot; Those
        19 received permanent implants; 7 of them subsequently
        developed infections. Let's ignore the issue of assessing
        subjective pain relief, and concentrate on the design.<br />
        a) This is an observational study.<br />

        ii) The fact that the surgeons knew who had received

        hometown, Lake Wobegon, MN, &quot;where all the women are
        strong, all the men are good looking, and all the
        children are above average.&quot; This must be a
        fictitious place because:<br />
        a) Norwegian bachelor farmers aren't that good looking.<br />
        b) Only half the children in any town can be above
        average.<br />
        c) People from Minnesota aren't any stronger,
        better-looking, or smarter than the rest of us.<br />
        d) In any reasonably large sample of people, such as a
        town, there's bound to be a weak woman, an unattractive
        man, or an unintelligent child.<br />

        of IQ of men and of women is 15 points, and the
        correlation coefficient between the IQ's of wives and
        husbands is 0.8. The scatterplot of IQ's is
        football-shaped. The regression line prediction of the

    <li>This refers to the question about the IQs of married
        couples.<br />
        i) Because of regression towards the mean, the woman with
        the highest IQ will be married to a man whose IQ is lower
        than hers. <br />
        ii) In spite of regression towards the mean, the woman
        with the highest IQ is likely to be married to a man
        whose IQ is even higher than hers, because smart men
        don't like to marry women who are smarter than they are.<br />
        iii) Because of regression towards the mean, a child of
        the woman with the highest IQ (assuming she has children)
        is likely to have an IQ that is above average, but not as
        high as hers. <br />
        a) i is true; ii and iii are false.<br />
        b) i and iii are true; ii is false.<br />
        c) ii is true; i and iii are false.<br />

    <li>Y. Zhang <em>et al.</em>, in &quot;Bone mass and the risk
        of breast cancer among postmenopausal women,&quot; <em>New
        England J. Medicine, 336</em>, 611-617, 1997, report on
        the incidence of breast cancer among 1373 women who had
        had hand X-rays between 1967 and 1970, had not had breast
        cancer at that time, and were age 47-80 at that time. The
        area of one of the bones in their wrists was measured
        from the X-ray images. The women were followed until
        1993. By that time, 91 of the subjects had developed
        breast cancer. In analyzing the data, the scientists
        divided the women into two-year age groups to control for
        the effect of age on bone area (people tend to lose bone
        mass after maturity). They also tried to control for
        education, height, body mass, age at first pregnancy,
        parity (number of children), age at menopause, alcohol
        consumption, cigarette smoking, level of physical
        activity, and use of postmenopausal estrogen, on the
        incidence of breast cancer, with which all of these
        factors have been associated. (They do this
        &quot;controlling&quot; using a multivariate regression
        model, which we shall not question here.) After adjusting
        for these other factors, there was an association between
        bone area and the incidence of breast cancer: the
        incidence of breast cancer among women in the top
        quartile of bone area (adjusted for age) was about 3.5
        times higher than the incidence among women in the bottom
        quartile. There is a known positive association between
        long-term postmenopausal estrogen exposure and retention
        of bone mass, and there is a known positive association
        between estrogen level at a given time and breast cancer.<br />
        a) Because this is a longitudinal study, the effects of
        confounding should be reduced.<br />
        b) Because this is a cross-sectional study, age is likely
        to be confounded with other factors.<br />
        c) This study provides evidence that long-term estrogen
        exposure increases the risk of breast cancer.<br />
        d) (a) and (c) are true.<br />
        <strong>e) None of the above is true.</strong><br />
