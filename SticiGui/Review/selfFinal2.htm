    <li>A researcher is developing genetic screening for a certain type of cancer. She has
      discovered that a certain genetic marker is associated with the cancer: 0.5% of the
      general population (including those with and without the genetic marker) are afflicted
      with this kind of cancer at some point in their lives, 0.1% of the general population have
      the genetic marker, and 20% of those with the genetic marker will eventually contract the
      disease. The researcher develops a genetic test that is 95% accurate: the chance that an
      individual with the marker tests positive for the marker is 95%, and the chance that an
      individual without the marker tests negative for the marker is 95%.<br />

<li>(Refers to headache problem.) To test whether the headache remedy works, I propose a
      randomized, controlled, double-blind experiment: I will find 10 volunteers who suffer
      regularly from headaches. Each will be given two pills, one of which is a placebo, and one
      of which contains the remedy I want to test. The pills are labeled &quot;A&quot; and
      &quot;B.&quot; The subjects are instructed to take pill &quot;A&quot; the first time they
      get a headache, and pill &quot;B&quot; the second time. They are to write down how long it
      took for their headache to abate each time, and report the result to me (assume that they
      do this perfectly accurately). For half the subjects, pill &quot;A&quot; is placebo and
      pill &quot;B&quot; is remedy; for the other half, it's the other way around. Which
      subjects get remedy first is decided randomly by assigning each subject a random number
      between zero and one. The 5 subjects who were assigned the largest random numbers get
      treatment first; the other 5 get placebo first.<br />
      <br />
      Of the two headaches each subject has during the study, one will last longer. It is
      reasonable to assume that if the remedy does not work, the longer headache would be
      equally likely to be either the remedy-treated headache or the placebo-treated headache.
      Assume also that if the remedy does not work, whether the remedy-treated or
      placebo-treated headache lasts longer is independent for different individuals.<br />

<li>A researcher wishes to determine the effect of dietary fat intake on serum (blood)
      cholesterol level. He takes random samples of 1,000 adults each from the populations of 80
      countries, and makes a scatterplot of average serum cholesterol (milligrams per deciliter;
      mg/dl) versus average daily fat intake (in grams) for the countries (the scatterplot has
      80 points, one for each country). The scatterplot is roughly football-shaped. The
      correlation coefficient between fat intake and serum cholesterol is 0.8. The regression
      line has slope 2 (2mg/dl of serum cholesterol per gram of fat per day).<br />

      i) For the sample, people who consume one less gram of fat per day than average have a
      serum cholesterol level about 2mg/dl less than average.<br />
      ii) An adult should expect that for each gram of fat he eliminates from his daily diet,
      his serum cholesterol level will fall by about 2 mg/dl.<br />
      iii) Because of ecological correlation, this study has little bearing on the effect of
      dietary fat on serum cholesterol for individuals.<br />
      iv) Because this is an observational study, one should not infer a causal relationship
      between dietary fat intake and serum cholesterol level from the observed association.<br />
