<h1>
    Testing Equality of Two Percentages

<p>
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--

    introduced a conceptual framework for statistical hypothesis testing.
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('experiments') + ', ');
// -->
</script>
    presented important
    statistical considerations for determining whether a 
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#treatment">treatment</a>
    has an effect.
    Treatment is meant loosely&mdash;it could be a drug, an advertising campaign, a car wax,
    a test preparation course, a fertilizer, <em>etc</em>.
    The best way to determine whether a treatment has an effect is to use the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#method_of_comparison">method of comparison</a> in an
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#experiment">experiment</a> in which 
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#subject">subjects</a>
    are assigned at random to the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#treatment_group">treatment group</a>
    or the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#control_group">control group</a>.
</p>

<p>
    When the measurement of each subject can be represented by 0 or 1 (<em>e.g.</em>,
    subject's condition improves or not, subject buys something or not, subject clicks a
    link or not, subject passes an exam or not), deciding whether the treatment has an effect
    is essentially testing the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#null_hypothesis">null hypothesis</a>
    that two percentages are equal&mdash;which is the problem this chapter addresses.
</p>

<p>
    Different ways of drawing samples lead to different tests.
    In one sampling design (the <em>randomization model</em>), the entire
    collection of subjects is allocated randomly between treatment and control,
    which makes the samples <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#dependent">dependent</a>.
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#conditional_probability">Conditioning</a>
    on the total number of ones in the treatment and control groups leads to
    <em>Fisher's exact test</em>, which is based on the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#hypergeometric">hypergeometric distribution</a>
    of the number of ones in the treatment group if the null hypothesis is true.
    When the sample sizes are large, calculating the rejection region for
    Fisher's Exact Test is cumbersome, but the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#normal_approximation">normal approximation</a>
    to the hypergeometric distribution gives an <em>approximate test</em>&mdash;a test
    whose <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#significance">significance level</a>
    is approximately what it claims to be.
</p>

<p>
    In a second sampling design (the <em>population model</em>), the two samples are
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#independent">independent</a> random samples with replacement
    from two populations; conditioning on the total number of ones in the two samples
    again leads to Fisher's exact test, which can be approximated as before.
</p>

<p>
    There is another approximate approach to testing the null hypothesis in the
    population model: If the sample sizes are large (but the samples are drawn with
    replacement or are small compared to the two population sizes), the
    normal approximation to the distribution of the difference between the two
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_percentage">sample percentages</a> tends to be accurate.
    If the null hypothesis is true, the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#expectation">expected value</a>
    of the difference between the sample percentages is zero, and the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#se">SE</a> of the difference in sample percentages can be
    estimated by pooling the two samples.
    That allows one to transform the difference of sample percentages approximately into
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#standard_units">standard units</a>, and to base an hypothesis
    test on the normal approximation to the probability distribution of the approximately
    standardized difference.
    Surprisingly, the resulting approximate test is essentially the normal
    approximation to Fisher's exact test, even though the assumptions of
    the two tests are different.

</p>

<p>
    Suppose we own a start-up company that offers e-tailers a service for targeting their
    Web advertising.
    Consumers register with our service by filling out a form indicating their likes
    and dislikes, gender, age, etc. We store cookies on each consumer’s computer to keep
    track of who he is.
    When a consumer with one of our cookies visits the Web site of any of our clients,
    we use the consumer's likes and dislikes to select (from a collection of the client's ads)
    the advertisement we think he is most likely to respond to.
    This is called <em>targeted advertising</em>.
    The targeting service is free to consumers; we charge the e-tailers.
    We can raise venture capital if we can show that targeting makes e-tailers'
    advertisements more effective.
</p>

<p>
    We offer our service free to a large e-tailer. The e-tailer has a collection of
    advertisements that it usually uses in rotation: Each time a consumer arrives at
    the site, the server selects the next ad in the sequence to show to the consumer;
    the cycle starts over when all the ads have been shown.
</p>

<p>
    To test whether targeting works, we implement a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#randomized">randomized, controlled</a>,
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#blind">blind experiment</a> by installing our software on the e-tailer's
    server to work as follows: Each time a consumer arrives at the site, with probability 50%
    the server shows the consumer the ad our targeting software selects, and with probability
    50% the server shows the consumer the next ad in the rotation&mdash;the control ad.
    The decision of whether to show a consumer the targeted ad or the control ad is
    independent from consumer to consumer.
    For each consumer, the software records which strategy was used (target or rotation),
    and whether the consumer buys anything.
    The consumers who were shown the targeted ad comprise the treatment group;
    the other consumers comprise the control group.
    If a consumer visits the site more than once during the trial period, we ignore all of
    that consumer's visits but the first.
    Each subject (consumer) is assigned at random either to treatment or to control,
    and no subject knows which group he is in, so this is a controlled, randomized,
    blind experiment.
    There is no subjective element to determining whether a subject purchased something,
    so the lack of a double blind does not introduce bias.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose that <span class="math">N</span> consumers visit the site during the trial, that
    <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> of
    them are assigned to the treatment group, that <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span>
    of them are assigned
    to the control group, and that <span class="math">G</span> of the consumers buy something.
    (The mnemonic is that <span class="math">c</span> stands for control, 
    <span class="math">t</span> for treatment,
    and <span class="math">G</span> for the number of <em>good</em> 
    customers&mdash;customers who buy something.)
    We want to know whether the targeting affects whether subjects buy anything.
    Only some of the consumers see the targeted ad, and only some see the
    control ad, so answering this question involves hypothetical
    counterfactual situations&mdash;what would have happened had the all the
    consumers been shown a targeted ad, and what would have happened
    had all the consumers been shown a control ad.
    We treat the <span class="math">N</span> consumers as a fixed group, without regard for how
    they were drawn from the more general population of people who shop online.
    Any conclusions we draw about the consumers who visited the site might not
    hold for the general population: We should be wary of extrapolating the
    results to consumers who were not in the sample unless we know that the
    randomized group is itself a random sample from the larger population.
    This set-up, in which the <span class="math">N</span> subjects are a fixed group and the only
    random element is in allocating some of the subjects to the treatment
    group and the rest to the control group, is called the <em>randomization model</em>.
    Later in this chapter we consider a <em>population model</em>, in which the
    treatment group and the control group are random samples from a much larger
    population.
    In the population model, the null hypothesis will be slightly different,
    but we shall be able to extrapolate the results from the samples to the
    populations from which they were drawn, because they were drawn at random.
</p>

<p>
    We can think of the experiment in the following way: The <span class="math">i</span>th
    consumer has a ticket with two numbers on it: 
    The first number,
    <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span>, is 1 if the consumer would have bought something if shown the
    control ad, and 0 if not.
    The second number, <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>, is 1 if the consumer would have bought something
    if shown the targeted ad, and 0 if not.
    There are <span class="math">N</span> tickets in all.
    Under the null hypothesis that targeting has no effect,
    <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub>=c<sub>i</sub></span> for each
    <span class="math">i=1, 2, &nbsp;&hellip;</span> , <span class="math">N</span>.
    That is, each consumer either will buy or will not buy,
    regardless of the ad he is shown: Whether he will buy is determined
    before he is assigned to treatment or control.
</p>

<p>
    For the <span class="math">i</span>th consumer, we observe either <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span>
    or <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>, but not both.
    The percentage of consumers who would have purchased something
    if every consumer had been shown the control ads is
</p>

<p class="math">
    p<sub>c</sub> = ( c<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub> +  &hellip;  +
    c<sub>N</sub> )/N.
</p>

<p>
    The percentage of consumers who would have bought something if all had
    been shown the targeted ads is
</p>

<p class="math">
    p<sub>t</sub> = ( t<sub>1</sub> + t<sub>2</sub>
    + &hellip; + t<sub>N</sub> )/N.
</p>

<p>
    Let
</p>

<p class="math">
    &mu; = p<sub>t</sub> &minus; p<sub>c</sub>
</p>

<p>
    be the difference between the percentage of consumers who would have
    bought had all been shown the targeted ad, and the percentage of
    consumers who would have bought had all been shown the control ad.
    Under the null hypothesis that targeting does not make a difference,
    <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub> = c<sub>i</sub></span> for all
    <span class="math">i=1, 2, &hellip;</span> , <span class="math">N</span>.
    Thus if the null hypothesis is true, <span class="math">&mu;  =  0</span>, but the
    hypothesis that <span class="math">&mu;&nbsp;= &nbsp;0</span> is weaker than the null
    hypothesis: If <span class="math">&mu;&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0</span>, the null hypothesis is
    false, but the null hypothesis can be false and yet still <span class="math">&mu;  =  0</span>.
    (That occurs if the number of consumers who would have bought something
    if all had been shown the targeted ads is equal to the number of consumers
    who would have bought something if all had been shown the control ads,
    but the purchases were made by a different subset of consumers.)
    The alternative hypothesis, that targeting helps, is that <span class="math">&mu;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0</span>.
    We would like to test the null hypothesis at significance level 5%.
</p>


<p>
    Let <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> be the number of sales to consumers
    in the treatment group,
    the sum of the observed values of <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>.
    If the null hypothesis is true, the same <span class="math">G</span> consumers would have bought
    whether they were assigned to treatment or to control, and the number
    of the consumers in the treatment group who bought something is the
    number of those <span class="math">G</span> in a simple random sample of size
    <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> from the population of <span class="math">N</span> consumers.
    Thus, for any fixed values of <span class="math">N</span>, <span class="math">G</span>, and
    <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>, <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> has an
    hypergeometric distribution with parameters <span class="math">N</span>, <span class="math">G</span>,
    and <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>.
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    If the alternative hypothesis <span class="math">&mu;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0</span> is true,
    <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> tends to
    be larger than it would if the null hypothesis is true,
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = 'Technically, it is <em>stochastically larger</em>: for every <span class="math">x</span>, ' +
           'the chance that <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;x</span> is at least as large ' +
           'if the alternative hypothesis is true as it is if the null hypothesis is true.';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
    so we should design our test to reject the null hypothesis for large
    values of <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span>.
    That is, our rejection region should contain all values exceeding
    some threshold value <span class="math">x<sub>0</sub></span>: We will reject the null hypothesis if
    <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub>  &gt; x<sub>0</sub></span>.
    We need to pick <span class="math">x<sub>0</sub></span> so that the test has the desired significance level, 5%.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    We cannot calculate the threshold value <span class="math">x<sub>0</sub></span> until we know
    <span class="math">N</span>, <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>, and <span class="math">G</span>.
    Once we observe them, we can find the smallest value <span class="math">x<sub>0</sub></span> so that the
    probability that <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> is larger than 
    <span class="math">x<sub>0</sub></span> if the
    null hypothesis is true
    is at most 5%, the chosen significance level.
    Our rule for testing the null hypothesis then is to reject the null
    hypothesis if <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub> &gt; x<sub>0</sub></span>,
    and not to reject the null hypothesis otherwise.
    This is called <em>Fisher's exact test</em> for the equality of two
    percentages (against a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sides">one-sided alternative</a>).
    The test is called <em>exact</em> because its probability of a
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#type_error">Type I error</a> can be computed exactly.

<p>
    If <span class="math">N</span> is large and <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>
    is neither close to zero nor close to <span class="math">N</span>,
    computing the hypergeometric probabilities will be difficult,
    but the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#normal_approximation">normal approximation</a>
    to the probability distribution of <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span>
    should be accurate provided <span class="math">G</span>
    is neither too close to zero nor too close to <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>.
    To calculate the normal approximation, we need to convert <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span>

    the result is an (approximate) 5% significance level test of the null

    This is the <em>normal approximation to Fisher's exact test</em>; <span class="math">Z</span> is called the

    examines in more generality the normal approximation to test
    statistics transformed approximately to standard units.
    Later in this chapter we shall see another example, the <em>z</em> test for
    equality of two percentages from independent samples.
</p>

<p>
    To test at a significance level other than 5%, reject when <span class="math">Z</span> exceeds a
    different threshold; choose the threshold so that the area under
    the normal curve to the right of the threshold is equal to the desired
    significance level.
    For example, to test at significance level 0.1, reject if <span class="math">Z&gt;1.282</span>.
    Some new notation will make it easier to express the general strategy.
    Recall that the normal curve is positive, and the total area under the
    normal curve is 100%, so the normal curve is like a histogram.
    Quantiles of the normal curve are defined thusly: For any number &alpha; between 0 and 100%,
    the &alpha; quantile of the normal curve, <span class="math">z<sub>&alpha;</sub></span>, 
    is the unique number such
    that the area under the normal curve to the left of <span class="math">z<sub>&alpha;</sub></span>
    is <span class="math">&alpha;</span>.
    For example, <span class="math">z<sub>50%</sub>  =  0</span>, because the area under the normal curve
    to the left of zero is 50%.

    Because the normal curve is symmetric about zero,

    Note that the area under the normal curve between <span class="math">z<sub>&alpha;</sub></span> and

    With this notation for quantiles of the normal curve, it is easier to write down the
    rejection region of the normal approximation to Fisher's exact test for a general
    significance level: The significance level of the rule
    <span class="math">{Reject the null hypothesis if Z&gt;z<sub>100%&minus;&alpha;</sub>}</span>
    is approximately <span class="math">&alpha;</span>.

<h2>
    <a id="equality_indep_samples"></a>Testing the Equality of Two Percentages Using
    Independent Samples
</h2>

<p>
    In the experiment to test the effectiveness of targeted advertising using the
    randomization model described previously in this chapter,
    the samples from the populations of control and treatment values are dependent:
    Individual <span class="math">i</span> has two numbers, <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span> and
    <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>, and if we observe <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span>
    we cannot observe <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>, and vice versa.
    If individual <span class="math">i</span> is in the treatment group, he or she is not
    in the control group, and vice versa. Under the null hypothesis,
    the purchasers would have bought whether they were assigned
    to treatment or to control, and the non-purchasers would not have bought
    whether they were assigned to treatment or control, so the total number
    of purchasers does not depend on which consumers were assigned to treatment.
    That constancy led to an hypergeometric distribution for the number of
    purchasers in the treatment group under the null hypothesis.
    In this section, we see that Fisher's exact test allows us to test a
    slightly weaker null hypothesis when the data are two independent random
    samples with replacement from separate populations, a control group and a
    treatment group.
    This is the <em>population model</em> for comparing two percentages.
</p>

<p>
    The weaker hypothesis is that the population percentage of the treatment
    group is equal to the population percentage of the control group.
    We also develop an approximate test for the equality of two percentages based
    on the sample percentages of independent random samples with replacement from
    two populations.
    The approximate test is essentially equivalent to the normal approximation
    to Fisher's exact test when the sample sizes are large.
</p>

<h3>
    <a id="fisherExactIndep"></a>Fisher's Exact Test Using Independent Samples
</h3>

<p>
    Suppose there are two populations of tickets labeled 0 and 1, a control
    group and a treatment group, with corresponding population percentages
    <span class="math">p<sub>c</sub></span> and <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub></span>.
    We want to test the null hypothesis that
</p>

<p class="math">
    p<sub>c</sub>  =  p<sub>t</sub>;
</p>

<p>
    <em>i.e.</em>, that
</p>

<p class="math">
    &mu;  =  p<sub>t</sub> &minus; p<sub>c</sub> = 0.
</p>

<p>
    We draw a random sample of size <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span> with replacement from the
    control group, and compute
    the sample sum <span class="math">X<sub>c</sub></span>.
    <span class="math">X<sub>c</sub></span> has a binomial distribution with parameters
    <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span> and <span class="math">p<sub>c</sub></span>.
    We draw another random sample of size <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> with
    replacement from the treatment group,
    and compute the sample sum <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span>.
    <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> has a binomial distribution with parameters
    <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> and <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub></span>.
    We draw the two random samples independently of each other, so
    <span class="math">X<sub>c</sub></span> and <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> are
    independent random variables.
    This scenario could correspond to an observational study, to a
    non-randomized experiment, or to a randomized experiment, depending upon how individuals
    came to be in the treatment group and the control group.
    The randomness in the problem at this point is in drawing the samples
    from the control group and the treatment group, not in assigning subjects
    to treatment or to control&mdash;that assignment occurred before we
    arrived on the scene.
    In this population model, we might be able to conclude from the data
    that the population percentages differ for the treatment and control
    groups (that <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub> &ne;p<sub>c</sub></span>),
    but even then we should not conclude that treatment has an effect unless the
    assignment of subjects to treatment and control was randomized.
    Otherwise, any real difference between <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub></span>
    and <span class="math">p<sub>c</sub></span> could be the result of confounding,
    rather than the result of the treatment.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, in the randomization model described earlier in the
    chapter, we might be able to conclude that the treatment has an
    effect for the <span class="math">N</span> subjects in the randomization, but even then we
    should not extrapolate from those <span class="math">N</span> subjects to conclude that
    treatment has an effect in the larger population from which they the
    subjects were drawn, because we did not know <em>how</em> they were drawn.

    but here is an explanation:
    If the null hypothesis is true, there is no difference between drawing with
    replacement from the treatment group and drawing with replacement from the
    control group, so every way of allocating the <span class="math">N</span> observed values
    into a group of size <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> and a group of size
    <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span> is equally likely.
    There are <span class="math"><sub>G</sub>C<sub>n<sub>t</sub></sub></span>
    such ways, of which
</p>
</div>

<p class="math">
    <sub>G</sub>C<sub>x</sub>&times;
    <sub>N&minus;G</sub>C<sub>n<sub>t</sub>&minus;x</sub>
</p>

<p>
    result in <span class="math">x</span> ones and <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub> &minus; x</span> zeros among the
    <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> values drawn from the treatment group,
    so the chance that <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub>=x</span> is
</p>

<p class="math">
    <sub>G</sub>C<sub>x</sub> &times;
    <sub>N&minus;G</sub>C<sub>n<sub>t</sub>&minus;x</sub>/<sub>G</sub>C<sub>n<sub>t</sub></sub>:
</p>

<p>
    given the value of <span class="math">G</span>, <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> has an hypergeometric
    distribution with parameters <span class="math">N</span>, <span class="math">G</span>, and <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>
    if the null hypothesis is true.
    Thus, under the null hypothesis that
    <span class="math">p<sub>c</sub>=p<sub>t</sub></span>,
    given the total number <span class="math">G</span> of ones in the sample,
    the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#test_statistic">test statistic</a>
    <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> has the same distribution for this
    sampling design that the test statistic <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span>
    did for a population of <span class="math">N</span> subjects assigned randomly to
    treatment or control.
    Therefore, the same testing procedure, Fisher's exact test, can be
    used to test the null hypothesis that
    <span class="math">p<sub>c</sub>=p<sub>t</sub></span>
    using independent random samples from two populations.
    In the previous section, the null hypothesis and the sampling design
    were different: Each subject <span class="math">i</span> had two values, 
    <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>
    and <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span>; the null
    hypothesis was that
</p>

<p class="math">
    t<sub>i</sub> = c<sub>i</sub> for all
    i=1, 2, &hellip; ,N;
</p>

<p>
    and each of the <span class="math">N</span> subjects was assigned at
    random either to treatment or to control.
</p>

<p>
    As noted previously, it is hard to perform the calculations needed to find the
    rejection region for this test when <span class="math">N</span> is large; the normal approximation
    to Fisher's exact test described in the previous section is a computationally
    tractable way to construct the rejection region.
    The approximation is accurate under the same assumptions.
</p>

<h3>
    <a id="ztestindep">The <em>Z</em> Test for the Equality of Two Percentages using
    Independent Samples</a>
</h3>

<p>
    In this section, we develop another approximate test of the null hypothesis that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>=p<sub>c</sub></span>
    in the population model; it turns out that this test is essentially the same
    as the normal approximation to Fisher's exact test, although it is motivated
    quite differently.
</p>

<p>
    Let <span class="math">&phi;<sub>c</sub></span> be the sample percentage of the random
    sample from the control group, and let <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t</sub></span> be the
    sample percentage of the random sample from the treatment group.
    Suppose that the two sample sizes <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span> and
    <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> are large (say, over 100 each).
    Then the normal approximations to the two sample percentages should be
    accurate (provided neither <span class="math">p<sub>c</sub></span> nor
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub></span> is too close to 0 or to 1).
    The expected value of the sample percentage of a random sample with
    replacement is the population percentage, so the expected value of
    <span class="math">&phi;<sub>c</sub></span> is <span class="math">p<sub>c</sub></span>,
    and the expected value of <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t</sub></span> is
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub></span>.
    The SE of <span class="math">&phi;<sub>c</sub></span> is
</p>

<p class="math">
    SE(&phi;<sub>c</sub>) = (
    p<sub>c</sub>&times;(1&minus;p<sub>c</sub>)
    )<sup>&frac12;</sup>/n<sub>c</sub><sup>&frac12;</sup>,
</p>

<p>
    and the SE of <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t</sub></span> is
</p>

<p class="math">
    SE(&phi;<sub>t</sub>) = (
        p<sub>t</sub>&times;(1&minus;p<sub>t</sub>)
        )<sup>&frac12;</sup>/n<sub>t</sub><sup>&frac12;</sup>.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the difference of the two sample percentages
</p>

<p class="math">
    &phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub> =
    &phi;<sub>t</sub> &minus; &phi;<sub>c</sub>.
</p>

<p>
    The difference <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub></span> is a random variable.
    The expected value of <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub></span> is
</p>

<p class="math">
    &mu; = p<sub>t</sub> &minus; p<sub>c</sub>.
</p>

<p>
    Because the samples from the treatment and control groups are independent of
    each other,  <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t</sub></span> and <span class="math">&phi;<sub>c</sub></span>
    are independent, so the SE of <span class="math">&phi;</span> is
</p>

<p class="math">
    SE(&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub>) = ( SE<sup>2</sup>(&phi;<sub>t</sub>) +
    SE<sup>2</sup>(&phi;<sub>c</sub>) )<sup>&frac12;</sup>.
</p>

<p>
    If the null hypothesis is true, the two population percentages are
    equal&mdash;<span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>=p<sub>c</sub>=p</span>&mdash;and
    the two samples are like one larger sample from a single 0-1 box with a percentage <span class="math">p</span>
    of tickets labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    Let us call that box the <em>null box</em>.
    If the null hypothesis is true, the expected value of <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub></span>,
    <span class="math">E(&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub>)</span>, is zero, and
</p>

<p class="math">
    SE(&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub>) =
    (p&times;(1&minus;p)/n<sub>t</sub> +
    p&times;(1&minus;p)/n<sub>c</sub> )<sup>&frac12;</sup>
</p>

<p class="math">
    = ( 1/n<sub>t</sub> + 1/n<sub>c</sub> )<sup>&frac12;</sup>
    &times; (p&times;(1&minus;p))<sup>&frac12;</sup>
</p>

<p class="math">
    = ( N/(n<sub>t</sub>&times;n<sub>c</sub>) )<sup>&frac12;</sup>
    &times; (p&times;(1&minus;p))<sup>&frac12;</sup>.
</p>

<p>
    The first factor depends only on the sample sizes <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> and
    <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span>, which we know.
    The second factor is the SD of the labels on the tickets in the null box.
    That factor depends only on <span class="math">p</span>, the percentage of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
    in the null box.
    We do not know <span class="math">p</span>, so we do not know the SD of the null box.
    However, we can use the bootstrap estimate of the SD of the
    null box because the sample size is large: let <span class="math">&phi;</span> be
    the pooled sample percentage
</p>

<p class="math">
    &phi; = (total number of &quot;1&quot;s in both samples)/(total sample size)
</p>

<p class="math">
    = (n<sub>c</sub>&times;&phi;<sub>c</sub> +
    n<sub>t</sub>&times;&phi;<sub>t</sub>)/N.
</p>

<p>
    The pooled bootstrap estimate of the SD of the null box is the
    estimate we get by pretending that the percentage of ones in the null box
    is equal to the percentage of ones in the pooled sample:
</p>

<p class="math">
    s<sup>*</sup> = (pooled bootstrap estimate of SD of the null box) =
    ( &phi;&times;(1&minus;&phi;) )<sup>&frac12;</sup>.
</p>

<p>
    If the sample sizes are large and the null hypothesis is true,
    this will tend to be close to the true SD of the null box, and
</p>

<p class="math">
    SE*(&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub>) =
    ( N/(n<sub>t</sub>&times;n<sub>c</sub>)
    )<sup>&frac12;</sup>&times;s<sup>*</sup>
</p>

<p>
    will tend to be quite close to SE(<span class="math">&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub></span>).
    The normal approximation to the probability distribution of
    <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub></span> tells us that the chance
    that <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub></span> is in a given range is
    approximately equal to the area under the normal curve for the same range,
    converted to standard units. Under the null hypothesis, the expected
    value of <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub></span> is zero,
    and <span class="math">SE(&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub>)</span> is approximately
    <span class="math">SE*(&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub>)</span>, so

<p>
    is approximately <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t&minus;c</sub></span> in standard units:
    The chance that <span class="math">Z</span> is in the range of values 
    <span class="math">[a, b]</span> is approximately the
    area under the normal curve between <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Under the alternative hypothesis that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>&gt;p<sub>c</sub></span>,
    <span class="math">Z</span> will tend to be larger than it would under the null hypothesis.
    We can test the null hypothesis that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>=p<sub>c</sub></span>
    against the one-sided alternative hypothesis that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>&gt;p<sub>c</sub></span>
    using

    To test at approximate significance level <span class="math">&alpha;</span>, reject the null hypothesis if
    <span class="math">Z&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;z<sub>1&minus;&alpha;</sub></span>.
</p>

<p>
    This is called the (one-sided) <em><em>z</em> test for equality of two percentages using
    independent samples</em>.
    The random variable <span class="math">Z</span> is called the  <em>Z</em>-statistic, and the observed value of
    <span class="math">Z</span> is called the <em>z</em>-score.
    To test the null hypothesis against the other
    one-sided alternative hypothesis that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>&lt;p<sub>c</sub></span>
    at approximate significance level <span class="math">&alpha;</span>, reject the null hypothesis if
    <span class="math">Z&lt;z<sub>&alpha;</sub></span>.
    To test the null hypothesis against the a two-sided alternative hypothesis that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>&ne;p<sub>c</em></sub></span>
    at approximate significance level <span class="math">&alpha;</span>, reject when
    <span class="math">|Z|&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;z<sub>1&minus;a/2</sub></span>.
</p>

<p>
    This test is based on transforming the difference of sample percentages
    (the test statistic) approximately to standard units, under the assumption
    that the null hypothesis is true.
    Because the null hypothesis specifies that the two population percentages
    are equal, the expected value of the difference between the sample percentages
    is zero&mdash;the expected values of both sample percentages is <span class="math">p</span>.
    However, the null hypothesis does not specify the value of <span class="math">p</span>,
    and the SE of the difference of sample percentages depends on <span class="math">p</span>,
    so we cannot calculate the SE of the test statistic under the null
    hypotheses&mdash;we have to estimate 
    <span class="math">SE(&phi;<sub>t &minus; c</sub>)</span>
    from the data.
    When the combined sample size
    <span class="math">N=n<sub>t</sub>+n<sub>c</sub></span> is
    sufficiently large,
    the pooled bootstrap estimate of the SD of the null box is likely
    to be quite accurate, and the estimated SE is likely to be very closet to the
    true SE.
    When the individual sample sizes are large, the probability histogram of
    the difference of sample percentages can be approximated well by the normal curve.
</p>

<p>
    When the sample is not large, the estimated SE will tend to differ from the
    true SE, and the normal approximation to the distribution of the difference
    of sample percentages will not be accurate.
    Then, the actual significance level of the <em>z</em> test can be very different from its 
    nominal significance level,
    and we need to be more circumspect; see

<h2>
    <a id="fisherApproxZtest">The Normal Approximation to Fisher's Exact Test and the <em>z</em> Test
    for Equality of Two Percentages</a>
</h2>

<p>
    We derived the <em>z</em> test for equality of two percentages using the assumption
    that the two samples are independent and that their sizes are fixed in advance.
    We derived Fisher's exact test by conditioning on the total number of tickets
    in the sample labeled &quot;1,&quot; and found that the test could be used in
    two quite different situations: to test the hypothesis that treatment has no
    effect when a fixed collection of individuals are randomized into treatment
    and control groups, so the treatment and control samples are dependent;
    and to test the hypothesis that two population percentages are equal from
    independent samples from the two populations.
</p>

<p>
    Somewhat surprisingly, the normal approximation to Fisher's exact test is
    essentially the <em>z</em> test when the sample sizes are all large.
    (The difference is just the &minus;1 in the denominator of the finite
    population correction, which is negligible if the samples are large.)
    That is, the <em>z</em> score in the normal approximation to Fisher's exact
    test is almost exactly equal to the <em>z</em> score in the <em>z</em>-test for
    equality of two percentages using independent samples:
    The two tests reject for essentially the same observed data values.
</p>

<p>
    The following example illustrates the approximate equivalence between the <em>z</em> test
    and the normal approximation to Fisher's exact test.
    The example is dynamic:
    The data will tend to change when you reload the page, to provide more
    examples of the computations involved.

<p>
    It is rather surprising that tests derived under different assumptions behave so similarly.
    Generally, when the assumptions of a test are violated, the nominal significance level
    will be incorrect and the test should not be used.
    This is a rare exception.

<h2>
    <a id="summary"></a>Summary
</h2>

<p>
    Suppose two variables, <span class="math">C</span> and <span class="math">T</span>, 
    are defined for a group of <span class="math">N</span>
    individuals: <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span>
    is the value of <span class="math">C</span> for the <span class="math">i</span>th 
    individual, and <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span> is the
    value of <span class="math">T</span> for the <span class="math">i</span>th individual,
    <span class="math">i=1, 2, &hellip;, N</span>.
    Suppose each <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span> and each <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>
    can equal either 0 or 1, so that
</p>

<p class="math">
    p<sub>c</sub>=(c<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub> +
    &hellip; + c<sub>N</sub>)/N
</p>

<p>
    is the population percentage of the values of <span class="math">C</span>, and
</p>

<p class="math">
    p<sub>t</sub>=(t<sub>1</sub> + t<sub>2</sub> +
    &hellip; + t<sub>N</sub>)/N
</p>

<p>
    is the population percentage of the values of <span class="math">T</span>.
    A simple random sample of size <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> will be taken from the population.
    The values of <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span> are observed for the units in the sample;
    for the <span class="math">N&minus;n<sub>t</sub></span> units not in the sample,
    the values of <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span> are observed instead.
    This is the <em>randomization model</em> for evaluating whether a treatment has
    an effect in an experiment in which a fixed set of <span class="math">N</span> units are
    assigned at random either to treatment or to control.
    The response of individual <span class="math">i</span> is 
    <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span> if he is treated
    and <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span> if not.
    At issue is whether the treatment has an effect.
    The null hypothesis is that treatment does not matter at all:
    <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub>=t<sub>i</sub></span>, for every individual <span class="math">i</span>.
    Let <span class="math">G</span> be the sum of all the observations, the observed values of
    <span class="math">c<sub>i</sub></span> plus the observed values of
    <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>.
    Let <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> be the sum of the observed values
    of <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span>.
</p>

<p>
    If the null hypothesis is true, the <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> observed values of
    <span class="math">t<sub>i</sub></span> are like
    a random sample from a 0-1 box of <span class="math">N</span> tickets of which 
    <span class="math">G</span> are labeled 1.
    Thus <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> has an hypergeometric distribution with parameters
    <span class="math">N</span>, <span class="math">G</span>, and <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>.
    Fisher’s exact test uses <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> as the test statistic, and this
    hypergeometric distribution to select the rejection region.
    If the alternative hypothesis is that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub> &gt; p<sub>c</sub></span>, then if the alternative
    hypothesis is true <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> would tend to be larger than it would be if the
    null hypothesis is true, so the hypothesis test should be of the form
    <span class="math">{Reject if X<sub>t</sub>&gt;x<sub>0</sub>}</span>, 
    with <span class="math">x<sub>0</sub></span>
    chosen so that the test has the
    desired significance level.
    If the sample sizes are large, it can be difficult to calculate the
    rejection region for Fisher's exact test; then the normal approximation
    to the hypergeometric distribution can be used to construct a test
    with approximately the correct significance level.
    In the normal approximation to Fisher's exact test, the rejection
    region for approximate significance level a uses the threshold for
    rejection

    <span class="math">z<sub>&alpha;</sub></span> equals <span class="math">&alpha;</span>.
    For example, <span class="math">z<sub>0.05</sub>=&minus;1.645</span>, and
    <span class="math">z<sub>0.95</sub>=1.645</span>.
</p>

<p>
    A <em>Z</em>-statistic is a test statistic whose 
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#prob_histogram">probability histogram</a>
    can be approximated well by a normal curve if the null hypothesis is true.
    The observed value of a <em>Z</em>-statistic is called the <em>z</em>-score.
    In Fisher's exact test,
</p>

<p class="math">
    Z =
    (X<sub>t</sub>&minus;n<sub>t</sub> &times;
    G/N)/(f&times;n<sub>t</sub><sup>&frac12;</sup>&times;(G/N &times;(1&minus;G/N))<sup>&frac12;</sup>)
</p>

<p>
    is a <em>Z</em> statistic.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose one wants to test the null hypothesis that two population percentages
    are equal, <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>=p<sub>c</sub></span>, on
    the basis of independent random samples with replacement
    from the two populations.
    This is the <span class="termOfArt">population model</span> for comparing two population percentages.
    Let <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> denote the size of the random sample from the first population;
    let <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span> be the size of the sample from the second population; and
    let <span class="math">N=n<sub>t</sub>+n<sub>c</sub></span> be the
    total sample size.
    Let <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> denote the sample sum of the first sample;
    let <span class="math">X<sub>c</sub></span> denote the sample
    sum of the second sample; and let
</p>

<p class="math">
    G=X<sub>t</sub>+X<sub>c</sub>
</p>

<p>
    denote the sum of the two samples.
    Conditional on the value of <span class="math">G</span>, the probability distribution of 
    <span class="math">X<sub>t</sub></span> is
    hypergeometric with parameters <span class="math">N</span>, 
    <span class="math">G</span>, and <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>,
    so Fisher's exact test can be used to test the null hypothesis.
    There is a different approximate approach based on the normal approximation
    to the probability distribution of the sample percentages:
    Let <span class="math">&phi;<sub>t</sub></span> denote the sample percentage of the sample from the
    first population;
    let <span class="math">&phi;<sub>c</sub></span> denote the sample percentage of the sample from the
    second population; and let <span class="math">&phi;</span> denote the overall sample percentage of the two
    samples pooled together,
</p>

<p class="math">
    &phi;=(total number of &quot;1&quot;s in the two samples)/(total sample size) = G/N.
</p>

<p>
    Then, if the null hypothesis is true,
</p>

<p class="math">
    E(&phi;<sub>t</sub>&minus;&phi;<sub>c</sub>)=0.
</p>

<p>
    If in addition <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span> and 
    <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span>
    are large, 
    <span class="math">SE(&phi;<sub>t</sub>&minus;&phi;<sub>c</sub>)</span> is approximately
</p>

<p class="math">
    s<sup>*</sup>&times;(1/n<sub>t</sub> +
    1/n<sub>c</sub>)<sup>&frac12;</sup>,
</p>

<p>
    where
</p>

<p class="math">
    s<sup>*</sup>=(&phi;&times;(1&minus;&phi;))<sup>&frac12;</sup>
</p>

<p>
    is the <em>pooled bootstrap estimate</em> of the SD of the null box.
    Under the null hypothesis, for large sample sizes <span class="math">n<sub>t</sub></span>
    and <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub></span>, the probability histogram of
</p>

<p class="math">
    Z =
    (&phi;<sub>t</sub>&minus;&phi;<sub>c</sub>)/(s<sup>*</sup> &times;
    (1/n<sub>t</sub>
    + 1/n<sub>c</sub>)<sup>&frac12;</sup>)
</p>

<p>
    can be approximated accurately by the normal curve, so <span class="math">Z</span> is a 
    <span class="math">Z</span>-statistic.
    To test the null hypothesis against the one-sided alternative that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>&lt;p<sub>c</sub></span>
    at approximate significance level <span class="math">&alpha;</span>, use a one-sided test that rejects
    the null hypothesis when 
    <span class="math">Z&lt;z<sub>&alpha;</sub></span>.
    To test the null hypothesis against the one-sided alternative that
    <span class="math">p</span><sub>t</sub>&gt;p<sub>c</sub></span> at approximate
    significance level <span class="math">&alpha;</span>, use a one-sided test
    that rejects the null hypothesis when <span class="math">Z&gt;z<sub>1&minus;&alpha;</sub></span>.
    To test the null hypothesis against the two-sided alternative that
    <span class="math">p<sub>t</sub>&ne;p<sub>c</sub></span> at
    approximate significance level <span class="math">&alpha;</span>, use a
    two-sided test that rejects the null hypothesis when
    <span class="math">|Z|&ge;z<sub>1&minus;&alpha;/2</sub></span>.
    The <em>Z</em> test for the equality of two percentages is essentially equivalent
    to the normal approximation to Fisher's exact test when the sample sizes
    are all large, even though the assumptions of the tests differ.
