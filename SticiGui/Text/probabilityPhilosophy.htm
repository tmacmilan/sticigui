  Probability: Philosophy and Mathematical Background
</h1>

<p>
    Probability is the study of randomness.
    It has a mathematical aspect and a philosophical aspect.
    The mathematical aspect is described in
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('probabilityAxioms') + '. ');
// -->
</script>
    The philosophical aspect, described in this chapter, connects the
    mathematical theory with the world&mdash;it says what &quot;probability&quot;
    means when we make statements like
    &quot;the probability that a fair coin lands heads is 50%.&quot;

<h3>
   <a id="random_events"></a>Random events
</h3>

<p>
    What does <em>random</em> mean?
    In ordinary speech, we use <em>random</em> to
    denote things that are unpredictable or not deliberate.
    For instance, we might speak of &quot;a random person off the street,&quot; or
    quip that &quot;Philip said the most random thing in lecture today!&quot;
    In this course, we distinguish between
    <span class="termOfArt">random</span> and <span class="termOfArt">haphazard</span>.
    Events that are random are not perfectly
    predictable, but they have long-term regularities that we can
    describe and quantify using probability.
    In contrast, haphazard events do not necessarily have long-term regularities.
    Moreover, we limit the term <span class="termOfArt">probability</span> to events for which we can
    specify all possible outcomes.
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
  How a fair coin lands when it is tossed vigorously is a canonical
  example of a random event.
  One cannot predict perfectly whether the coin will land heads or tails;
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = "Some sleight-of-hand artists can toss a &quot;fair&quot; coin in " +
           "such a way as to make it land heads a very large fraction of the " +
           "time (more than 9 times out of 10). It takes a lot of practice.";
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
  however, in repeated tosses, the fraction of times the
  coin lands heads will tend to settle down to a limit of 50%.
  The outcome of an individual toss is not perfectly predictable, but the long-run
  average behavior is predictable.
  Thus it is reasonable to consider the outcome of tossing a fair coin to be random.
</p>
</div>


<p>
    What does it mean to say that a fair coin toss has a 50% chance of landing heads?
    There are several standard answers, called <span class="termOfArt">Theories of Probability</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Theories of Probability assign meaning to statements like
    &quot;the probability that <span class="math">A</span> occurs is <span class="math">p</span>%.&quot;
    Theories of probability connect the mathematics of probability to the real world.
    As you might expect, bridging mathematics to reality is not so easy&mdash;the
    philosophical problems are deep, and it is hard to be consistent without being
    circular.
    We shall examine three theories of probability.
    The one I find most satisfactory is the Frequency Theory,
    although the others have their places too.
    In all three theories, probability is on a scale of 0% to 100%.
    &quot;Probability&quot; and &quot;chance&quot; are synonymous.

    Equally Likely Outcomes
</h3>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0QMTspSJM0g?start=405&end=862" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>
    This theory of probability is the oldest.
    It originated in the study of games of chance, such as dice games and card games.
    In the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes, probability assignments depend on the
    assertion that no particular outcome is preferred over any other by Nature; generally,
    arguments that Nature should show no preference among the outcomes appeal to the
    symmetry of the system studied (such as a &quot;fair&quot; coin or die).
</p>

<p>
    If a given experiment or trial has <span class="math">n</span> possible outcomes among
    which&mdash;it is assumed&mdash;Nature should show no preference, this
    theory defines them to be <span class="termOfArt">equally likely</span>.
    The probability of each outcome is then <span class="math">100%/n</span>.
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    Applying this theory of probability involves arguing that no particular outcome should occur
    in preference to another, typically by appeal to physical symmetries
    or other considerations&mdash;e.g., that there is no reason one marble would be predisposed
    to turn up rather than another in drawing a marble from a well-stirred bowl of marbles.
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = 'Laplace\'s <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#principle_of_insufficient_reason">' +
               '<span class="termOfArt">Principle of Insufficient Reason</span></a> asserts that if there ' +
               'is no reason to think that a set of outcomes is not equally likely, they should ' +
               'be taken to be equally likely.  This is poor logic: no evidence of a difference ' +
               'is not the same as evidence of no difference.  The fallacy is called ' +
               '<a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#appeal_to_ignorance">' +
               '<span class="termOfArt">Appeal to Ignorance</a></span>. See also ' +
               '<a href="references.htm">Freedman and Stark, 2003</a>.';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
    For example, if a coin is balanced well, there is no reason for it to
    land heads in preference to tails when it is tossed vigorously,
    so according to the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes,
    the probability that the coin lands heads is equal to the
    probability that the coin lands tails, and both are 100%/2 = 50%.
    (This ignores the nearly impossible outcomes that the coin does not
    land at all or lands balanced on its edge.)
    Similarly, if a die is fair
    (properly balanced) the chance that when it is rolled vigorously
    it lands with the side with one spot on top (the chance that the die <em>shows</em>
    one spot) is the same as the chance that it shows two spots or three
    spots or four spots or five spots or six spots: 100%/6, about 16.7%.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    If an <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#event">event</a> consists of more than one possible
    outcome, the chance of the event is the number of ways it can occur, divided by the total
    number of things that could occur.
    For example, the chance that a die lands showing an even number of spots
    is the number of ways it could land showing an even number of spots
    (3, namely, landing showing 2, 4, or 6 spots), divided by the total
    number of things that could occur
    (6, namely, landing showing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 spots).
    Since the total number of possible outcomes is <span class="math">n</span>, the maximum possible
    probability of any event is <span class="math">100%&times;n/n = 100%</span>.
    Thus, in the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes, probabilities are between 0%
    and 100%, as claimed.
</p>

<h3><a id="frequency_theory"></a>
    Frequency Theory
</h3>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0QMTspSJM0g?start=862&end=1290" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    In the Frequency Theory of Probability,
    probability is the limit of the relative frequency
    with which an event occurs in repeated trials.<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = 'The trials must be <a class="glossRef" ' +
               'href="gloss.htm#independent">independent</a>&mdash;more about this in ' +
                citeLinkChapter('probabilityAxioms') + '.';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
    Relative frequencies are always between 0% (the event essentially never happens)
    and 100% (the event essentially always happens), so in this theory as well, probabilities
    are between 0% and 100%.
    According to the Frequency Theory of Probability, what it means to
    say that &quot;the probability that <span class="math">A</span> occurs is
    <span class="math">p</span>%&quot; is that
    if you repeat the experiment over and over again, independently and
    under essentially identical conditions, the percentage of the time
    that <span class="math">A</span> occurs will converge to <span class="math">p</span>.
    For example, under the Frequency Theory, to say that the chance
    that a coin lands heads is 50% <em>means</em> that if you toss the coin over and over again,
    independently, the ratio of the number of times the coin lands heads to the
    total number of tosses approaches a limiting value of 50% as the number
    of tosses grows.
    Because the ratio of heads to tosses is always between 0% and 100%, when the
    probability exists it must be between 0% and 100%.

<h3><a id="subjective_theory"></a>
    The Subjective Theory
</h3>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0QMTspSJM0g?start=1290&end=1629" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>
    In the Subjective Theory of Probability, probability measures the speaker's
    &quot;degree of belief&quot; that the event will occur, on a scale of 0%
    (complete disbelief that the event will happen) to 100%
    (certainty that the event will happen).
    According to the Subjective Theory, what it means for me to say that
    &quot;the probability that <span class="math">A</span> occurs is 2/3&quot; is that
    I believe that <span class="math">A</span> will happen twice as strongly as I believe
    that <span class="math">A</span> will not happen.
    The Subjective Theory is particularly useful in assigning meaning to the
    probability of events that in principle can occur only once.
    For example, how might one assign meaning to a statement like
    &quot;there is a 25% chance of an earthquake on the San Andreas fault
    with magnitude 8 or larger before 2050?&quot;
    (See <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf">Freedman and Stark, 2003</a>,
    for more discussion
    of theories of probability and their application to earthquakes.)
    It is very hard to use either the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes
    or the Frequency Theory to make sense of the assertion.
    Can you think of other examples?
</p>

<p>
    These three theories of probability assign different meanings to the statement
    &quot;the chance that <span class="math">A</span> occurs is <span class="math">p%</span>.&quot;
    Each theory has situations in which it is most natural, and each
    theory has shortcomings.
    This book uses the Frequency Theory primarily.

<h2>

<h3>The Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes
</h3>
<p>
    Even when there are only a few possible outcomes, it is not always clear whether
    they should be deemed equally likely.
    For example, consider tossing two coins at the same time.
    The possible outcomes could be {two heads, not two heads} or
    {two heads, one head and one tail, two tails} or
    {two heads, head on coin 1 and tail on coin 2, tail on coin 1 and head on
    coin 2, two tails}.
</p>

<p>
    The last of these assigns the same probabilities the
    Frequency Theory does.
    For instance, if the equally likely outcomes are taken to be
    {two heads, head on coin 1 and tail on coin 2, tail on coin 1 and head on
    coin 2, two tails}, both the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes and the Frequency Theory
    would say that the chance of two heads is 25%.
    If one is using probability to bet on games of chance, long-term relative
    frequencies&mdash;which the Frequency Theory contemplates&mdash;are perhaps the most
    important consideration, because they determine how much one wins or loses in
    the long run.
    It seems rather artificial to introduce a distinction between two otherwise
    identical coins in order to make the probabilities calculated using the
    Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes agree with the probabilities calculated using
    the Frequency Theory.
    Perhaps a more serious limitation of the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes is that
    many situations do not have natural symmetries to exploit to decide which outcomes
    are equally likely.
    For example, what is the chance that a thumbtack lands with its point up when it
    is tossed vigorously? What is the chance that a die that has been &quot;loaded&quot;
    (modified to be unbalanced) lands showing one spot?
    Neither of these problems has a natural symmetry from which to argue that the
    outcomes are equally likely.
    Moreover, in many situations there are an infinite number of possible outcomes;
    dividing 100% by infinity yields zero.
</p>

<h3>
    The Frequency Theory
</h3>
<p>
    The Frequency Theory requires an assumption about how the world works:
    The relative frequency with which an event occurs in repeated trials
    is <em>assumed</em> to converge to a limit.
    What is a limit?
    In the case of coin tossing, the theory says that for any positive
    number <span class="math">a</span>, no matter how small, there is some number
    <span class="math">M</span>, which can depend
    on <span class="math">a</span>, such that
</p>

<p class="math">
    | (#heads in n tosses)/n &minus; 50% |
    &lt; a
</p>

<p>
    whenever the number of tosses <span class="math">n &gt; M</span>.
    Not all sequences of heads and tails satisfy this assumption.
    For example, suppose the first toss gives a head.
    The relative frequency of heads is then 100%.
    Suppose the next 3 tosses give tails.
    The relative frequency of heads is then 25%.
    Suppose the next 100 tosses give heads.
    The relative frequency of heads is then over 97%.
    Suppose the next 5000 tosses give tails.
    The relative frequency of heads is then about 20%.
    If we continue in this way, with ever longer runs of heads and of tails,
    the relative frequency of heads never approaches a limit.
</p>

<p>
    <a id="empirical_law_of_averages"></a>
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#empirical_law_of_averages">Empirical Law of Averages</a>
    says this never happens:
    The world works in such a way that the relative frequency with which a random
    event occurs in repeated trials always settles down to a limit.
    This &quot;law&quot; is an <em>assumption</em> about how the world works.
    It is not a mathematical fact, and it is not an observation because no one can continue
    tossing coins forever to see whether the relative frequency of heads starts to vary
    again after, say, 100,000,000,000,000 tosses.
    The Empirical Law of Averages is essential to the Frequency Theory.
</p>

<p>
    The second limitation of the Frequency Theory is that many events to which
    we might like to assign probabilities are not the outcomes of repeatable experiments.
    For example, what is the probability that the universe will end in a &quot;big crunch?&quot;
    What is the probability that my 2015 tax return will be audited?
    What is the probability that in 2020 more online textbooks than paper
    textbooks will be sold?
    What is the probability that the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaches 20,000
    before the year 2020?
    Can you think of other examples?
</p>

<h3>
    The Subjective Theory
</h3>
<p>
    The principal shortcoming of the Subjective Theory is that colloquially we think
    of probability as being a property of an event in the external (objective) world,
    not merely a reflection of our state of mind.
    When I say &quot;this thumbtack has probability 66% of landing point up when I toss it,&quot;
    you probably think I am talking about the tack, not about my state of mind with
    respect to the tack: this theory changes the subject.
    Similarly, under the Subjective Theory, you and I can disagree about the probability
    of an event and both be correct, which seems unsatisfactory in many scientific
    settings.
</p>

<p>
    There are a variety of technical difficulties in the Subjective Theory regarding how to
    measure the probability of an event.
    One possible resolution is to study the bets you are willing to take.
    Would you be indifferent between a bet that a coin lands heads and a bet with the
    same stakes that it lands tails?
    If so, some theorists would conclude that your subjective probability that the coin
    lands heads is 50%.
    Some factors can complicate this approach.
    For example, even though you know that buying a lottery ticket is almost certainly
    throwing your money away, you might buy a ticket anyway, reasoning that you would
    not particularly miss the $1 cost of the ticket, while you would definitely notice
    winning $20,000,000.
    In this scenario, the <em>probability</em> of winning is less of an issue than the
    <em>possibility</em> of winning.
</p>

<p>
    Here is another example: I will bet you $1,000,000 against $500 that there will
    not be a nuclear bomb dropped on Berkeley, California, by the year 2020.
    Even if I am confident that a nuclear bomb will be dropped, if it is dropped,
    I won't have to pay off the lost bet (I live in Berkeley), but if it is not dropped,
    I could use the $500 you would owe me.
</p>

<p>
    Another problem with the Subjective Theory has to do with
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#scientific_method">scientific method</a>.
    Some philosophers of science maintain that unless an hypothesis can,
    in principle, be shown to be false, it is not scientific.
    An hypothesis that in principle can be disproved is called <em>falsifiable</em>.
    In the Frequency Theory, one can collect evidence against the statement that
    &quot;the probability that <span class="math">A</span> occurs
    is <span class="math">p</span>%&quot; by repeating an experiment
    over and over and looking at the fraction of times the event <span class="math">A</span> occurs.
    In the Subjective Theory, evidence against the hypothesis that
    &quot;the probability that <span class="math">A</span> occurs is <span class="math">p</span>%&quot;
    is found by psychological testing to see whether the individual making the
    statement is telling the truth and is internally consistent in his assignments
    of probability.
    Running the real-world experiment over would not be relevant.
</p>

<p>
    The following exercises check whether you understand the differences among the
    Theories of Probability.
    The examples illustrate using the Fundamental Rule of
    Counting and the Theories of Probability in more complex settings.

<p>
    In Lotto, you pick six numbers
    between 1 and 53; 6 numbers are drawn &quot;at random&quot; in such a way that every
    set of 6 distinct numbers between 1 and 53 is equally likely.
    To win the jackpot, all 6 of
    the numbers drawn must match the numbers you picked.
    The total number of combinations of
    53 numbers taken 6 at a time is \({}_{53}C_6 = 22,957,480\).
    Only one of those
    combinations matches your exactly, so the chance of winning the jackpot is \(1/(22,957,480)
    = 0.0000044\%\).
</p>

<p>
    There is a payoff of $5 if you match 3 of the 6 numbers.
    To match 3, the draw has to
    result in 3 of your 6 numbers, and in 3 of the 47 numbers you did not pick.
    You can think of this as a sequence of two experiments:
    drawing 3 numbers from among your 6 (which can
    result in
    \({}_6C_3 = 20\) possible outcomes), and drawing 3 numbers from the 47
    remaining numbers that are not among your six (which can result in
    \({}_{47}C_3 = 16,215\) possible outcomes).
    Because the number of possibilities in the second experiment does not depend on
    what happened in the first, we can apply the fundamental rule of counting to conclude that
    the total number of ways of drawing 3 of the 6 numbers you picked, and 3 of the 47 you did
    not pick, is <span class="math"><sub>6</sub>C<sub>3</sub>&times;<sub>47</sub>C<sub>3</sub></span>.
    The chance that the numbers drawn will match exactly 3 of your 6 numbers is therefore
</p>

<p class="math">
    <sub>6</sub>C<sub>3</sub>&times;<sub>47</sub>C<sub>3</sub>/<sub>53</sub>C<sub>6</sub>
    = 20&times;16,215/22,957,480

<p>
    What is the chance of being dealt exactly one pair (two of a kind) in a 5 card hand
    from a well shuffled deck of cards?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution.</strong>
    How many distinct 5-card hands can one form from a deck of 52 cards?
    In a hand of cards, the order in which you receive the cards does not matter.
    The number of 5-card hands is the number of ways of picking a set of 5
    things from 52 things, which is <span class="math"><sub>52</sub>C<sub>5</sub> = 52!/(5!&nbsp;47!)</span>.
    Assuming that the deck is well-shuffled, every 5-card hand is equally likely,
    so the chance of being dealt exactly one pair is the number of hands that contain
    exactly one pair, divided by the total number of hands (which we just found).
</p>

<p>
    To specify a hand containing one pair, we
    need to specify what <em>kind</em> the pair is of, the two <em>suits</em> of the cards
    in the pair, and the three remaining cards.
    Because we can think of this as a sequence of trials, we can invoke the Fundamental Rule
    of Counting to find the total number of hands that contain exactly one pair by
    multiplying the number of possible outcomes of each of these trials:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
      Ways of picking the kind of which to have a pair: There are 13 kinds in the deck, from
      which we need to pick one.
      There are <span class="math"><sub>13</sub>C<sub>1</sub> = 13</span> ways of doing that.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ways of picking the two suits of the cards in the pair: There are 4 suits in the deck,
      from which we need to pick two.
      There are <span class="math"><sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> = 6</span> ways of doing
      this.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ways of picking the kinds of the remaining three cards. There are 12 kinds of cards that
      are different from the one of which we have the pair. We need to pick three different ones
      (if two or more of the kinds of the three additional cards were the same, we'd either have
      two pair or a full house).
      There are <span class="math"><sub>12</sub>C<sub>3</sub> = 220</span> ways of doing this.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ways of picking the suits of the remaining three cards. For each of the three kinds, we
      have four choices of suit ( <span class="math"> = <sub>4</sub>C<sub>1</sub></span>),
      so by the Fundamental Rule of
      Counting, there are <span class="math">4&times;4&times;4 = 64</span> ways of doing this.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    By the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#fundamental_rule_of_counting">Fundamental Rule of Counting</a>,
    the total number of distinct 5-card hands that contain exactly one pair is
</p>

<p class="math">
    13&times;6&times;220&times;64 = 1,098,240.
</p>

<p>
    The probability of being dealt one of those hands from a well-shuffled deck is
    thus
</p>

<p class="math">
    1,098,240/<sub>52</sub>C<sub>5</sub> = 42.3%.

    What is the chance of being dealt two pair in a 5-card hand
    from a well-shuffled deck?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution.</strong>
    We need to specify which two kinds the pairs are of, the suits
    of those kinds, and the remaining (fifth) card.
    There are <span class="math"><sub>13</sub>C<sub>2</sub></span> ways
    of choosing the two kinds. For each of those choices, there are
    <span class="math"><sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub></span>
    ways of specifying the suits of each of those kinds individually
    (so there are <span class="math"><sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>
    &times; <sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub></span> ways of specifying the suits of the two cards of the two
    kinds).
    There are <span class="math">52&nbsp;-&nbsp;4&nbsp;-&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;44</span> cards in the deck that we
    could use for the fifth card, without making the hand be a full house, so there are
    <span class="math"><sub>44</sub>C<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;44</span> ways
    of choosing the fifth card.
    By the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#fundamental_rule_of_counting">fundamental

</p>

<p class="math">
    <sub>13</sub>C<sub>2</sub> &times;

      &times; <sub>44</sub>C<sub>1</sub>

<p>
    distinct five-card hands that comprise two pair.
    If the deck is well shuffled, each of the <span class="math"><sub>52</sub>C<sub>5</sub></span>
    five-card hands
    is equally likely, so the chance of being dealt two pair is
</p>

<p class="math">
  <sub>13</sub>C<sub>2</sub> &times; <sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> &times; <sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>

<p>
    What is the chance of being dealt a royal flush from a well-shuffled
    deck?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution.</strong>
    A royal flush is {10, J, Q, K, A} of the same suit.
    The only thing unspecified is the suit.
    There are 4 ways of picking a suit from the four
    (<span class="math"><sub>4</sub>C<sub>1</sub> = 4</span>), so there are 4
    ways of getting a royal flush. Again, assuming the deck is well-shuffled, the chance of a
    royal flush is <span class="math">4/(<sub>52</sub>C<sub>5</sub>)</span>.

<h2><a id="summary"></a>Summary</h2>

<p>
    Theories of Probability assign meaning to probability statements about the world.
    The Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes says that if an experiment must result
    in one of n outcomes, and there is no reason Nature should prefer one of
    the outcomes to another, then the probability of each outcome is
    <span class="math">100%/n</span>.
    The Frequency Theory says that the probability of an event is the limit of
    the relative frequency with which the event occurs in repeated trials under
    essentially identical conditions.
    The Subjective Theory says that probability is a measure of strength of
    belief on a scale of 0 to 100%.
