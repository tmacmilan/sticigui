<p>

    This applet illustrates the concept of the

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sampling_distribution">sampling distribution</a>

    of a <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#statistic">statistic</a>

    by simulating the sampling distribution of four common statistics:

    the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_sum">sample sum</a>,

    the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample mean</a>,

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#s-squared">S<sup>2</sup>, the sample variance</a>,

    and the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#chi-squared_statistic">Chi-Squared

    statistic</a>.

</p>



<p>

    Each time you press the "take sample" button, a (pseudo-) random sample is drawn from a

    population of numbers, and the statistic is computed from the sample.

    A <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>

    displays the history of values of the statistic as you take more and more samples;

    also, the display shows the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#mean">mean</a> and

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd">SD</a> of the sample values of the statistic.

    With the sample mean, sample sum, and sample S<sup>2</sup>, there are three

    choices for the population of numbers from which to draw

    each sample: from the list of numbers in the box on the right, from a uniform distribution,

    and from a normal distribution.

    With the sample chi-square statistic, the box contains the category probabilities

    for the population: each number in the box stands for a category of outcome;

    the value of the number is interpreted to be the probability of that outcome.

    (The numbers are automatically renormalized to sum to unity when the chi-square

    statistic is selected.)

</p>



<p>

    The <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_sum">sample

    sum</a> is the sum of a <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#random_sample">random

    sample</a> from a population. The <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample

    mean</a> is the usual average of a <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#random_sample">random

    sample</a> from a population: it is the sample sum, divided by

    the number of numbers in the sample (the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_size">sample

    size</a>). <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#s-squared">S<sup>2</sup></a>

    is the sum of the squares of the deviations of a random sample from its sample

    mean, divided by (sample size - 1).

</p>



<p>

    Suppose we have a random sample of size <em>n</em>; denote the data by

</p>

<p align="center">

    {X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ... , X<sub><em>n</em></sub>}.

</p>

<p>

    Then the sample sum is

</p>

<p align="center">

    X<sub>1</sub> + X<sub>2</sub> + ... + X<sub><em>n</em></sub>,

</p>

<p>

   the sample mean is

</p>

<p align="center">

   M = (X<sub>1</sub> + X<sub>2</sub> + ... + X<sub><em>n</em></sub>)/<em>n</em>,

</p>

<p>

  and S<sup>2</sup> is

</p>

<p align="center">

   S<sup>2</sup> = <big>(</big>

       (X<sub>1</sub> - M)<sup>2</sup> + (X<sub>2</sub> - M)<sup>2</sup> + ... +

       (X<sub><em>n</em></sub> - M)<sup>2</sup> <big>)</big>/(<em>n</em> - 1).

</p>

<p>

    The <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample mean</a>

    is a <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#statistic">statistic</a>

    commonly used to estimate the mean of a population.

    It is an <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#unbiased">unbiased</a> estimator

    of the population mean.

    The square-root of

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#s-squared">S<sup>2</sup></a> is a

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#statistic">statistic</a>

    commonly used to estimate the

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd">standard deviation</a> of a

    population.

    S<sup>2</sup> is an <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#unbiased">unbiased</a>

    estimator

    of the square of the population <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd">standard

    deviation</a>; in general, (S<sup>2</sup>)<sup>&frac12;</sup> is a

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#biased">biased</a> estimator

    of the population standard deviation.

</p>



<p>

    The blue <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>

    shows the distribution of the numbers in the box on the right,

    which initially contains the five numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. When

    you press the &quot;Take Sample&quot; button, the computer draws

    a pseudo-random sample with replacement from the population,

    computes the sum or mean of the sample, and plots the histogram

    of the result in green. As you take more samples, the green

    histogram will evolve, showing the distribution of the results.

    The value of the sample sum or sample mean is random, because it

    depends on the random sample. It is not the same every time a

    sample is drawn. The default sample size is 1. Because the

    average of one number is just that number, if you sample

    repeatedly, you will reproduce the histogram of the population.

    This is not terribly interesting.

</p>



<p>

    What is more interesting is what happens when you increase the

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_size">sample

    size</a>. You can change the sample size (the number of numbers

    in each sample) by typing a different number into the box labeled

    &quot;Sample Size,&quot; then striking the &quot;enter&quot; or

    &quot;return&quot; key. If you increase the sample size, the

    variability of the sample mean will be smaller, and the shape of

    the green histogram will look more nearly normal (as you sample

    repeatedly). You can speed things up by taking more than one

    sample at a time; this is controlled by the &quot;Take _____

    samples&quot; box. Another box controls the number of bins in the

    histograms. You will probably get the clearest impression of the

    phenomena we are trying to see by using the maximum number of

    bins.

</p>



<p><b>To Notice:</b> </p>



<ul>

    <li>

        The average of the sample means gets close to the

        population mean as you take more and more samples. This

        illustrates that the sample mean is an <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#unbiased">unbiased</a>

        <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#estimator">estimator</a>

        of the population mean.

    </li>

    <li>

        The variability (as measured by the standard error or <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#se">SE</a>) of

        the sample mean is smaller for larger sample sizes. It

        shrinks like the square-root of the sample size. This is

        an illustration of the <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#square_root_law">Square-root

        Law</a>.

    </li>

    <li>

        If the sample size is large, the histogram of the sample

        mean and sample sum approach the <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#normal_curve">normal

        curve</a> as you take more samples, even though the

        histogram of the population isn't even vaguely shaped

        like a normal curve. (Click the &quot;Show Normal

        Curve&quot; button to superpose the corresponding normal

        curve.) This is an illustration of the <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#clt">Central

        Limit Theorem</a>.

    </li>

</ul>



<h2 align="center">

  More Detail

</h2>



<p>

    The sample mean of a random sample from a population is an

    estimator of the mean of the population. The sample mean is a

    random variable, because its value depends on what the particular

    random sample happens to be. The <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#expectation">expected

    value</a> of the sample sum is the sample size times the

    population mean (the average of the numbers in the box). The

    standard error (<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#se">SE</a>)

    of the sample sum is the square-root of the sample size, times

    the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd">standard

    deviation</a> (SD) of the numbers in the box. The expected value

    of the sample mean is the population mean, and the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#se">SE</a> of the

    sample mean is the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd">SD</a> of the

    population, divided by the square-root of the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_size">sample

    size</a>.

</p>



<p>

    This applet lets you type a population of numbers into a box,

    then look at how the histogram of sample values of the sample

    mean evolves as you take more and more samples. There are

    controls for the sample size and the number of samples to take

    each time the &quot;Take Sample&quot; button is pushed, as well

    as a control for the number of bins in the histogram.

</p>



<p>

    If the sample size is sufficiently large, the histogram of the

    sampling distribution of the sample sum and sample mean,

    converted to standard units, follow the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#normal_curve">normal

    curve</a> approximately. A button in the applet lets you

    superpose the theoretical normal curve with the histogram of

    observed values of the sample sum or mean. Two controls

    (&quot;Highlight from&quot; and &quot;to&quot;) let you highlight

    part of the histogram, and compare the area of that part of the

    histogram with the area of the same part of the normal curve. For

    large sample size, the areas should become close as you take more

    and more samples of that fixed large size.

</p>



<p>

    To replace the contents of the box, delete the numbers in the

    box, type in the numbers you want, then click anywhere outside

    the box. You should then see a blue histogram of the population

    of numbers you typed into the box.

</p>



<p>

    Press the &quot;Take Sample&quot; button a few times, using

    the default sample size of one. You will see a histogram of

    sample values emerge in green. As you take more and more samples,

    the green histogram should get closer and closer to the blue one:

    the sample mean of a random sample of size one has the same

    distribution as the population. Increase the number of samples to

    take to 100 by typing into the corresponding box (&quot;Take ____

    samples&quot;) and striking the &quot;enter&quot; or

    &quot;return&quot; key. Press the &quot;Take Sample&quot; button

    a few times. The green and blue histograms should match pretty

    well---the observed sampling of samples of size one converges to

    the distribution of values of the population.

</p>



<p>

    Now change the &quot;Take ____ samples&quot; control back to

    one, and change the &quot;Sample Size&quot; to 50. This will

    clear the green histogram. Every time you press the &quot;Take

    Sample&quot; button now, you are computing the sample mean of a

    random sample of size 50 from the population of numbers you put

    into the box. The green histogram that evolves as you take more

    and more samples will be concentrated nearer the population mean

    than the blue histogram is. The values of the sample mean are

    more finely divided than the values in the population, as well.

    Change the &quot;Samples to Take&quot; to 100, and press the

    &quot;Take Sample&quot; button a few more times. As you take more

    and more samples, the mean of the green histogram that emerges

    will tend to be closer and closer to the mean of the population.

    The spread of the histogram, measured by its SE, will be about

    the SD of the population, divided by the square-root of 50 (about

    7). Press the &quot;Show Normal Curve&quot; button. The green

    histogram should follow the normal curve pretty well. You can

    compare areas under the histogram with the corresponding areas

    under the normal curve with the &quot;Highlight from&quot; and

    &quot;to&quot; controls.

</p>



<p>

    Now set the sample size up to 200, the maximum,

    and set the &quot;Samples to Take&quot; to 1. The

    green histogram will clear again. Take a few samples of size 200

    from your population. The values of the sample mean will be even

    more finely divided than before, and will tend to be even closer

    to the population mean. Slide the &quot;Samples to Take&quot;

    control up to a large value, and press the &quot;Take

    Sample&quot; button a few times. The green histogram should

    follow the normal curve very well. It should &quot;balance&quot;

    quite close to the population mean, and its width should be about

    the SD of the population, divided by about 14 (the square-root of

    200).

</p>



<p>

    The histogram of values of the chi-squared statistic also is approximated

    better and better by a normal curve as the sample size increases, if the

    number of categories is not too small.

    The histogram is approximated even better by the Chi-square curve with

    (<em>k</em> - 1) degrees of freedom, where <em>k</em> is the number of

    categories.

</p>



<p>

    The histogram of values of S<sup>2</sup> also is approximated better and

    better by the normal curve as the sample size increases, but

    the transformation to

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#standard_units">standard units</a>

    depends on the population in a complicated way,

    unless the population has

    a <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>.

<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript" ><!--

    var fStr = 'It depends on the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#moment">fourth ' +

               'moment</a> of the population.  For a normal ' +

               'distribution, the fourth moment has a simple expression in terms ' +

               'of the second moment.';

    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);

// -->

</script>

    If it does, for moderate sample sizes, the chi-squared curve gives a better

    approximation than the normal curve.

    The chi-square curve needs to be scaled, in much the same way as

    the normal approximation depends on transforming to standard units.

    In particular, it is the distribution of (sd<sup>2</sup>/(<em>n</em>-1))&times;

    S<sup>2</sup> that is approximated by the chi-squared curve with (<em>n</em>-1)

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#df">degrees of freedom</a>, where sd is the

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd">standard deviation</a> of the normal population.

</p>



<p>

    This applet illustrates several important statistical

    concepts:

</p>



<ol>

    <li>

        The <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample

        mean</a> of a <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#simple_random_sample">simple

        <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#estimator">estimator</a>

        of the population mean.

    </li>

    <li>

        The SD of the sample mean shrinks in proportion to the

        square-root of the sample size (the <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#square_root_law">Square-Root

        Law</a>).

    </li>

    <li>

        The distribution of the sample mean is nearly normal, for

        large enough samples, no matter what the distribution of

        the population is (the <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#clt">Central

        Limit Theorem</a>).

    </li>

    <li>

        The sample <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#s-squared">S<sup>2</sup>

</h2>



<p>

The choice box in

the title area lets you select either the sample mean or the

sample sum. Every time you press the &quot;Take Sample&quot;

button in the title area, samples with replacement are drawn from

the population of numbers in the box at the right hand side, and

either the sum or mean of each sample is taken, corresponding to

whichever is visible in the title. The &quot;Sample Size&quot;

box controls how large each sample is, and the &quot;Take ____

samples&quot; box controls how many samples of that size are

taken each time you press the &quot;Take sample&quot; button. The

mean and SD of the numbers in the box are displayed on the left,

along with the SE of the sample mean or sample sum (corresponding

to whichever is selected), and the number of sample valuesand

histograms of the numbers in the box and of the sample values of

the sample mean or sum are shown in the middle, in blue and

green, respectively. You can superpose the normal curve on the

histogram of sample values by clicking the &quot;Show Normal

Curve&quot; button.

</p>



<p>

The

&quot;Highlight from&quot; and &quot;To&quot; boxes let you

highlight a range of sample values in the histogram; the area of

the highlighted range of sample values (the proportion of values

of the sample mean or sample sum in the range) is then displayed,

along with the corresponding area under the normal curve, if the

normal curve is showing. When you switch between the sample sum

and the sample mean, the &quot;Highlight from&quot; and

&quot;To&quot; limits are transformed to correspond to the

equivalent range of sample values. The &quot;Bins&quot; box

controls the number of bins in the histograms. If you change the

sample size, the history of sample values will be reset and green

histogram will clear (you cannot mix sample sizes in the same

plot). Changing the number of samples to take does not clear the

history, nor does toggling back and forth between the sample sum

and the sample mean.

</p>



<p>

To change the

numbers in the population box, either delete the numbers in the

box using the backspace key and type in new values, or selecting

the numbers in the box and type over them. Then click outside the

population box to update the values. The display of the Ave(box),

SD(box) and SE(mean) or SE(sum) (depending on which is displayed)

will be updated to reflect the new contents of the box.

</p>



<p>

To change the

number in the &quot;Highlight From,&quot; &quot;To,&quot;

&quot;Sample Size,&quot; &quot;Take ____ Samples,&quot; or

&quot;Bins&quot; box, delete or select and type over the current

number, then strike the &quot;enter&quot; or &quot;return&quot;

key. The &quot;Highlight From&quot; and &quot;To&quot; values can

also be changed using the neighboring scrollbars.
